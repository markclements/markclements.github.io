# Course Materials

A textbook is not required for this course. All learning activities are free and accessed using NECCs Blackboard learning management system. Everyone will need to have access to the internet and a web browser to participate; I recommend that you use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). We will use [Microsoft Office 365](https://www.necc.mass.edu/succeed/student-support-services/technology-help/student-email/office-365-help-login/) for assignments that require word processing, presentations, drawing, or spreadsheets because and it is free for all NECC students to download and use. I also encourage all of you to share any blogs, web site URLs, books, videos, etc., that you find that might be of value to this course and your classmates.  
  
**[NECC requires students to have a laptop computer](https://www.necc.mass.edu/current-students/student-resources/laptop-requirement/) so you are expected to bring your laptop to all face-to-face meetings.**

# Course Requirements

## Methods of instruction

The course is divided into several modules. Modules have interactive discusions of background readings. The course may also include slide shows and additional media (articles and videos) and worksheets to introduce ideas. You will complete these and I will review them and identify difficult or confuisng ideas and provide feedback to you in my respsonse to help you better understand and makes sense of the material. Finally, there are lab activities that introduce scientific principles (experimental design, data collection, analysis, and evidence-based argumentation) and focus on the tools and techniques used in Biology.  

## Workload

The requires a minimum of 5 hours of coursework per week. Interactive readings and discussions are completed online and lab activities will be completed during scheduled meeting times. Attendance is required for all face-to-face meetings.  

### Reading + Discussion

The course uses reading text, or watching videos, combined with interactive discussions to assess understanding of basic knowledge. Reading + Discussion participation and level of engagement with your classmates and the instructor is assessed using the free Perusall app through Blackboard. For each assignment I will evaluate the annotations you submit on time. Based on the overall body of your annotations, you will receive a score for each assignment as follows

3 = demonstrates exceptionally thoughtful and thorough reading of the entire assignment\
2 = demonstrates thoughtful and thorough reading of the entire assignment\
1 = demonstrates superficial reading of the entire assignment OR thoughtful reading of only part of the assignment\
0 = demonstrates superficial reading of only part of the assignment

**How many annotations do I need to enter?**

I want annotations to reflect the effort you put in your study of the text. It is unlikely that that effort will be reflected by just a few annotations per assignment. On the other extreme, 30 per assignment is probably too many, unless a number of them are superficial or short comments or questions (which is fine, because it is OK to engage in chat with your peers). Somewhere in between these two extremes is about right and thoughtful questions or comments that stimulate discussion or thoughtful and helpful answers to other students' questions will earn you a higher score for the assignment. For this online course you must inlcude at least 8 annotations to recieve a score for the assignment. 

**What does "on time" mean?**

The interactive readings and discussions are the only way to introduce content and improve your understanding of the material so it is necessary to complete the reading and post your annotations by the deadline so that I can help you learn the material. 

### Lab Activities and Homework

These activities are submitted for review by the intructor and amy include: worksheets, spreadsheets, short writing assignments, and/or drawings. Activities that are submitted on time can be resubmitted, after reviewing my feedback, to improve your performance. All activities are scored as 0 (resubmit) or 1 (satisfactory). The most important criteria for evaluating activities is student effort; so please try to complete the entire assignment and follow all instructions and provide me with the evidence that you have tried your best. If something requires more effort or correction, I will help you improve your work.

## Communication and interaction

We will communicate outside of class using Perusall chat or NECC email. Importantly, you should ask questions and use me as much as possible. I am here for you!

## Blackboard

Please make sure to login to Blackboard every day. Announcements, class resources, and assignment submission will be handled through Blackboard. I will regularly send broadcast emails to the class through the Blackboard; this will send an email to your NECC student account, you can change which email account these messages are sent in your Blackboard settings.

## NECC Email

Please try to check your student email at least once per day. If you do not like the student email interface, it is easy to set up on your desktop client or mobile device. You can also forward your student mail to any other email account ([link to instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-on-automatic-forwarding-in-outlook-on-the-web-7f2670a1-7fff-4475-8a3c-5822d63b0c8e?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)).

Email or Perusal chat is the best way to contact me. If you send an email, you must include the following:  
- Your name  
- Your class (either course number or title)  
- A relevant subject  

## Participation Policy

We will meet 1 time per week for lab and these meetings are not optional. If you can not make it to a face-to-face, on-campus meeting you will not be allowed to make up the work for that day. However, I will drop the lowest score for lab and online activity. 

## Basis for Grading

Please make sure you check your grades for activities and discussion participation. Keeping track will ensure there are no discrepancies and surprises and notify you when I have provided feedback. Remember if course work is not submitted, then no feedback will be given, and you will not have the opportunity to improve your work. Deadlines for all assignments are not flexible and non-neotiable; it is important to me that you complete the work on time to the best of your abilities.

# Statement on Plagiarism and Academic Integrity

It is my goal to help you achieve your academic goals at NECC. Long term success is primarily determined by the skills and knowledge that you acquire from your coursework. It is most important that your academic achievements reflect your hard work and dedication to college. And when the latter is true, you will establish a reputation for honesty that will be more valuable than any grade that you receive in any class. Identifying ethical behaviors and establishing your personal integrity are the most important principles you will learn in college.

The following guidelines have been prepared so that you will understand what is expected of you in maintaining academic honesty:


1. All work in this class must be yours, unless I give you permission to collaborate with someone else. Please do not share your work with others -- I encourage you to discuss work with others, but you must do your own work.  

2. You should always give credit for material or ideas that you have obtained from a book, journal, magazine, or Web site. Please ask me for help if you are unsure how to properly acknowledge [your sources](http://necc.mass.libguides.com/noodletools). Failing to acknowledge that you have used another's material or ideas is considered cheating and plagiarism.

> Definition of Plagiarism:
>
> -   "The art of stealing words, ideas, etc. of another and using them as your own." (Webster's Dictionary)\
> -   "Take and use another author's thoughts, writings as one's own." (The Concise Oxford Dictionary)\
> -   "The appropriation or imitation of the language, ideas, and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one's original work."(The Random House Dictionary of the English Language)

Overt violations of these rules will result in any or all of the following:

-   a grade of "0" for the assignment in question, or  
-   a grade of "F" in the course,  
-   or disciplinary action according to College rules  

# Netiquette Guidelines

Please keep in mind the following guidelines when communicating with each other during this course:[^1]

[^1]: *The Core Rules of Netiquette are adapted from the book Netiquette by Virginia Shea*. Website: <http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html>

-   Always think before you write. Without the use of non-verbal communication as in conversation, your message can be misinterpreted. Please consider your tone before you hit submit.\

-   Keep it relevant. There are places to chat and post for fun. Please do not digress from the discussion in the assigned questions.\

-   Never use all caps. This is the equivalent of yelling in the online world. Only use capital letters when they are appropriate.\

-   Make sure that you are using appropriate grammar and structure.\

-   Treat people in the same way as you would treat them face-to-face. It is easy to hide behind the computer. In some cases, it empowers people to treat others in ways they would not in person. Please treat your fellow learners with dignity and respect.

-   Respect the time of others. This class may require you to work in groups. Please respect the time of others in your group. You may be one that works best with the pressures of a deadline, but others may not. The key to a successful group is organization, communication and a willingness to do what it takes to get it done.
